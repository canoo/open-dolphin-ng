= OpenDolphin - angular.js Adapter

== Build instructions

Prerequisites:

* npm installed
* gulp installed

=== with gradle:

Call `./gradlew buildjs`

[NOTE]
Internally this calls `npm install` and `gulp buildjs`

This produces a folder `gulp_out` with the files `ng-opendolphin.js` and `ng-opendolphin.min.js`



TBD: produce a jar file so that it can be referenced by java based web applications
