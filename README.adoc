= OpenDolphin - angular.js Adapter

== Build instructions

Prerequisites:

* npm installed

=== with gradle:

Call `./gradlew jar`

[NOTE]
Internally this calls `npm install` and `node ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js buildjs`

This produces a folder `gulp_out` with the files `ng-opendolphin.js` and `ng-opendolphin.min.js`.
In addition these files will be packed into a jar file: `build\libs\open-dolphin-ng.jar`

=== Upload to bintray

* increase version number in `build.gradle` if not already done and remove _-SNAPSHOT_ from it
* `./gradlew -i clean bintrayUpload`
